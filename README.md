## Hi there 👋

## Introduction

## About me
Hello! My name is Reno Sifana Paksi. I am a self-taught IT enthusiast and programmer. I have Cerebral Palsy, a condition I've had since birth. This means I cannot stand or walk like most people, and I have difficulty holding objects. While I cannot type with my left hand, I am able to hold objects and type using my right hand. My family is very supportive and always there to help me when I need it.

## Education
- Kindergarten
- State Elementary School (up to Grade 2).
- After that, I became self-taught by using the Internet. I learn from reading news, articles, blogs, Wikipedia, watching YouTube, and more. I always bookmark useful websites for future reference.

## Proficiency
- Indonesian (Native language)
- English (Second language). I would say I'm about 90% proficient and always eager to learn more.

## My Experience
- Used Microsoft Windows from the early 2000s until 2021.
- Switched to Linux in 2021 (running on an older laptop with an Intel Core i3 350M processor).
- Using Android phones since 2010 (I previously used Nokia feature phones).

## Operating Systems I Currently Use
- Linux Mint 22.1 (Based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS) on my laptop.
- MIUI 12.0.15 (Based on Android 10) on my Redmi 9A.

## Occupation
I currently contribute to [Wikimedia projects](https://wikimedia.org) (such as [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) and [Wiktionary](https://wiktionary.org)) and I am also a contributor at [AlternativeTo.net](https://alternativeto.net).
