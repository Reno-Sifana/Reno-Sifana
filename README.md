# Hi there, I'm Reno Sifana Paksi 👋
### Self-Taught IT Enthusiast & Documentation Specialist

I am a dedicated self-taught programmer and IT enthusiast with a passion for documentation, particularly using **Markdown**, **Plaintext**, and **Wikitext**.

I have Cerebral Palsy, a condition I've had since birth. While it presents some physical challenges—such as typing primarily with my right hand—it hasn't stopped me from pursuing my interest in technology. I am driven by curiosity and supported by a wonderful family, which allows me to continuously learn and grow at my own pace.

### 🚀 My Learning Journey
Most of the repositories you see on my profile are **forks**. I use these as personal learning journals and as a way to explore the inner workings of open-source projects. By forking and studying these codebases, I can experiment with code and document my findings, which is a key part of my self-taught education.
